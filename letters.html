<h3>Student Letters of Recommendation</h3>	
	
<p> If you have been in class with me, been my advisee, or otherwise been acquainted with me at the college, I am generally more than happy to write you a recommendation letter for your applications to graduate school, internships, and jobs.  However, please note that writing a letter is a time-consuming process.  In order to ensure you receive the best letter possible, please heed the following steps.  <br> 

<h4>Timeline and Approach</h4>	

<p> Please read this page and make sure you get me everything I need at least <font size="3" color="red"><b>three weeks prior</b></font> to any due date you have. Not all letters are the same: letters for graduate programs (especially doctoral programs) take more time than most job and career letters. If you are asking for a doctoral program letter, make sure to let me know in plenty of time - if you know that you're going to be asking me for a letter two months ahead of your due dates, let me know then. <br> 
	
<p> You can ask me for a letter over email, but if possible, it is better to ask in person. (You can schedule appointments with me <a href="appointments.html">here</a>.) This allows you to tell me about the programs and/or jobs that you are applying to, for us to talk about your application process, and for you to get a feel for the kind of letter I will be able to write for you.
	
<p> Finally, if I have already written a similar kind of letter for you, future letters take less time, and I need less notice. In this case, 10 days notice is sufficient.  However, if you are asking for a new kind of letter (say, you previously asked for an internship letter and now you are asking for a graduate letter) make sure to give me the full three weeks.

<h4>Materials</h4>	

<p>Once we have met, and you are sure that you want me to write a letter, please send me the following documents over email three weeks prior to your due dates:

<ol>
<li>Cover page and/or information sheet, including all schools/employers that you are applying to, their deadlines, and the specific location where I must send their letters.</li>
<li>Any additional forms I must complete with the letters.</li>
<li>Any and all materials that you submit with your applications, including but not limited to:</li>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Cover Letter</li>
	<li>Resume or CV</li>
	<li>Personal Statement, Statement of Interest, Diversity Statement, etc</li>
	<li>Writing Sample(s)</li>
	<li>Standardized Test Scores (GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc)</li> 
	<li>Unofficial transcripts for any college level courses not taken at New College.</li> 
</ol> 
<li>Optional: A note about skills and/or attributes you are emphasizing in your applications.</li>
</ol>
<p> Many students are often shy about including some of these materials (especially standardized test scores if they are low).  However, they allow me to write you the best letter that I can. If, for example, I see that you have a low quantitative GRE score, but you have taken a quantitative class with me and done very well, I can note that in your letter as reason for an evaluator to discount your GRE. 
	
<p>On a broader scale, your goal in most applications (and especially in graduate school applications) is to present yourself as a coherent and compelling package of skills, attributes, and goals - and your letters are part of that package presentation. Seeing how you are presenting yourself though your materials enables me to buttress that presentation in my letters.
 <br>
 
<h4>Reminders</h4>	

<p> If I have agreed to write you letters, and you have provided me with the above information, you are on my mind and in my calendar.  However, sometimes things slip - do not be shy about sending me a reminder one week before and 48 hours before your deadline (in fact, I strongly recommend it).  I will email you with a confirmation when I have submitted your letters.
 
<h4>Let me know what happens!</h4>	

<p> Finally, if I have written you a letter, that means I have invested a significant amount of time into trying to help you get into a career, internship, or graduate program. (Not to mention the amount of time I likely had you as a student or advisee.) Let me know how the applications go, if you got in, and where you will be attending school/accepting a job! <!--I genuinely appreciate knowing, but less than 50% of people I write letters for let me know about their outcomes.  Be part of the 50% that does!-->
 
<!--<h4>A Side Note: Advice on Selecting your Letter Writers</h4>	
	
<p> When selecting your letter writers, consider  . . . with all letter writers, remember: letters are not something you are <b>owed</b>, they are favors that someone (professor or otherwise) is doing for you. So always be courteous and considerate when requesting!  <br> -->
